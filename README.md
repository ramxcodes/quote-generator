#### JavaScript Code

The provided JavaScript code is responsible for generating and displaying random quotes. It uses the quotable.io API to fetch a random quote (with a maximum length of 100 characters) and displays it on the web page.

The code initializes the quote content and the author's name, and when the "New Quote" button is clicked, it fetches a new random quote from the API and updates the content and author.

Note: The JavaScript code uses a font-awesome quote icon (a small SVG icon) and makes use of the Clipboard.js library for copying content to the clipboard (not used in the provided code).

The "Quote Generator" web page is designed to generate random quotes and provide users with a new quote on each button click. It also includes links to the author's portfolio and social media profiles in the footer.
